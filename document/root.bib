  abstract = {This is an advanced 2001 textbook on modal logic, a field which caught the attention of computer scientists in the late 1970s. Researchers in areas ranging from economics to computational linguistics have since realised its worth. The book is for novices and for more experienced readers, with two distinct tracks clearly signposted at the start of each chapter. The development is mathematical; prior acquaintance with first-order logic and its semantics is assumed, and familiarity with the basic mathematical notions of set theory is required. The authors focus on the use of modal languages as tools to analyze the properties of relational structures, including their algorithmic and algebraic aspects, and applications to issues in logic and computer science such as completeness, computability and complexity are considered. Three appendices supply basic background information and numerous exercises are provided. Ideal for anyone wanting to learn modern modal logic.},

This entry formally defines the problem in the case where the needle's position is chosen uniformly at random in a single strip around the origin (which is equivalent to larger arrangements due to symmetry). It then provides proofs of the simple solution in the case where the needle's length is no greater than the width of the strips and the more complicated solution in the opposite case.},

  abstract = {Probability theory and fuzzy logic have been presented as quite distinct theoretical foundations for reasoning and decision making in situations of uncertainty. This paper establishes a common basis for both forms of logic of uncertainty in which a basic uncertainty logic is defined in terms of a valuation on a lattice of propositions. The (non-truth-functional) connectives for conjunction, disjunction, equivalence, implication, and negation are defined in terms which closely resemble those of probability theory. Addition of the axiom of the excluded middle to the basic logic gives a standard probability logic. Alternatively, addition of a requirement for strong truth-functionality (truth-value of connective determined by truth-value of constituents) gives a fuzzy logic with connectives, including implication, as in Lukasiewicz' infinitely valued logic. A common semantics for all such variants is given in terms of binary responses from a population. The type of population, e.g., physical events, people, or neurons, determines whether the model is of physical probability, subjective belief, or human decision-making. The formal theory and the semantics together illustrate clearly the precise similarities and differences between fuzzy and probability logics.},

A kind of paradox is alleged to arise from the uninhibited use of a statistical syllogism. It is possible to assign probabilities to at least three kinds of entities: sentences, propositions, and events. To avoid going back and forth between the sentence-approach of confirmation theory and the event-approach of standard probability theory, the chapter uses the event-language but standard sentential connectives to form terms denoting complex events. The chapter discusses the rule of detachment and explains that its application in an argument requires no query as to whether the total evidence has been considered; it has exactly the same status as the rule of detachment in deductive logic.},

Propositional and predicate logic are presented in an easy-to-read style using Gentzen's natural deduction. The book proceeds with some basic concepts and facts of model theory: a discussion on compactness, Skolem-L\"owenheim, non-standard models and quantifier elimination. The discussion of classical logic is concluded with a concise exposition of second-order logic. In view of the growing recognition of constructive methods and principles, intuitionistic logic and Kripke semantics is carefully explored. A number of specific constructive features, such as apartness and equality, the G\"odel translation, the disjunction and existence property are also included. The last chapter on G\"odel's first incompleteness theorem is self-contained and provides a systematic exposition of the necessary recursion theory. This new edition has been properly revised and contains a new section on ultra-products.},
